	<h1>Public Service Events</h1>
        <p>At APO we love helping our community 
	and we love working with our community on campus to help the Capital 
	Region. We have recently increased our public and joint events. Last year we hosted 2 events
	 at Sanctuary for Independent Media where we worked with over 5 on campus organizations. This 
	year we are hosting 
	<a href = "https://www.apoez.org/pages/service/serviceDay.php">Service Day</a> 
	on October 1st where we hope to 
	help any interested RPI student go out in the community and do some community service. 
	We are also always still planning to host at least 1 other public event and are always looking 
	to do joint events with other organizations. We do many
