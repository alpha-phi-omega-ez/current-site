	<h1>Our Service</h1>
        <p>During our 75 years we have received the Dean Arno Nowotny, an APO national service award, 
	a record breaking 5 times. Our chapter has a huge focus on helping our community and always have a 
	focus on service. We currently run the campus 
	<a href = "https://www.apoez.org/laf.php">Lost and Found</a>, 
	<a href = "https://www.apoez.org/backtest.php">Backtest Service</a>, and 
	<a href = "https://www.apoez.org/pages/service/charger.php.php">Charger Loan Service</a>. 
	We are always striving to use our 
	resources and apply our efforts to a diverse set of organizations. Since returning to campus full time 
	we have worked to do over 1000 hours each semester and plan to continue this. 
	As a group we hope our efforts make a difference in our community and are always 
	aiming to use our time to help wherever we can. </p>
