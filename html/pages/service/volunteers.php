        <p><b>What can we do for you?</b><br>
          Our chapter of Alpha Phi Omega has been committed to serving our community since 1947. Though we can't always promise that we can help your organization (our calendar fills up pretty quickly!) we will always do our best to fit you in.</p>
        <p>	The academic year runs between late August and early May, so those are the best times for us to help out your organization.</p>
        <p>	In the past we have done weekly projects such as tutoring, one-time projects such as painting, cooking, projects that require up to 30 people, and projects that only require one or two.</p>
        <p>	To see if we can help you out, please feel free to contact us at: <a href="mailto:apo@union.rpi.edu">apo@union.rpi.edu</a> or  <a href="mailto:service@apoez.org">service@apoez.org</a>.</p>
